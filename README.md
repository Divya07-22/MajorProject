- **Real-Time Transaction Analysis:** Users can initiate transactions which are immediately analyzed by a sophisticated AI engine.
- **Multi-Layered AI Engine:**
    - **Isolation Forest:** For anomaly detection.
    - **LSTM Autoencoder:** For behavioral profiling.
    - **Graph Neural Network (GNN):** For relational analysis (placeholder).
    - **XGBoost Meta-Model:** A final classifier that combines the scores from all other models to produce a definitive risk score.
- **Dynamic Risk Response:**
